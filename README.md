# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Using deep neural networking concepts to recognize handwritten digits

The goal is to predict the digit handwritten in an image. The dataset contains images of
handwritten digits and their respective numbers which can be used to train and test the model.
This is supervised learning problem more specifically a classification problem. The model should
be able to classify which number (0-9) is handwritten in the image. The model can be scored for its
ability to predict the number correctly over large different test data and real data.
